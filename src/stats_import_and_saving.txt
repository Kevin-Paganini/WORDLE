Importing and saving stats after every game

Initialize calls read method to read stats file and initialize stats to what they were stored as

Basic Idea:
After every game write to file
Session or some class reads in file and updates stats that way






after every game
write to file
Game num: x
Target: yyyyy
Guess num: x
Win: yes/no
Guesses


SAMPLE:
Game num: 12
Target: earth
Guess num: 3
Win: yes
reuse
afoul
earth



**BUG
Word and letter frequency incorrect after
Lost five time in a row inputting earth:
EXPECTED:
e: 30, a: 30, r: 30, t: 30, h: 30
earth: 30
GOT:
e: 90, a: 90, r: 90, t: 90, h: 90
earth: 90

Output file looks fine, however stats tab is incorrect

wordle could have a toString method that does this

when reading in parse this and write into an object than we can refactor session class to take in list of those objects
and then that can return the stats
