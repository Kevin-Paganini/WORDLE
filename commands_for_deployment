Deploying to Heroku is a pain but here are the commands

First commit everything to the gitlab branch

This is the command if the server is still on the server_second_try branch
then use the following command: git push heroku server_second_try:main

Command if you are on the main branch is:
git push heroku main


When it doesnt work use command: git logs --tail


Errors were getting right now when trying to deploy:

Mainly it is a timeout error
